### Method Selections

### Rationale for Doubly-linked Node-based Architecture
Our team choose doubly-linked Node-based architecture for Deque because Deque is a double ended queue. The instance variables nextNode and prevNode and their methods from the doubly-linked nodes would be useful in adding, removing, and peeking from the front or end of the queue.
